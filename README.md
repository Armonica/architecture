  NOTE:
   
    For the moment I'm alone on this trip, so if you're waiting to use this is clearly too soon.
    
    I'm searching for people that think this trip is relevant and wants to participate.
    
    Lets try thinking the same way.
    
    No `Grammar Nazi`, No killing procedures, No best practices (but ours), lets innovate and be cool.

Describing what I want to do in my freetime and when I want to work on something.

# TOC

Everything should be spliced in files. Not ready, yet.
