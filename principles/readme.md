# Principles

- end to end JSON Schema
- code reuse (that would be difficult in some situations)
- NO monolith
- Cyclic architecture review
- only one html file
- offline first, mobile first
- hyper-modularity (I was asked why I'm using `hyper` because `modular` is `arhi`-sufficient. No, is not. I have to find the right words to explain my view.), plugability and flexibility.
- Everything is replaceable. Of course, is not, but most of the things.
- DRY KISS with some limits, mainly because I aim complex behaviours.
- Flexible architecture that allows fast library update.
- Best of breed? Not necessary. But best fit to stack.  
- World Peace
