# Global ideas

JS only target. Plugable everything.

A full stack that registers itself each component, as independent as possible. I have to find the right balance. Every component is API or UI, there can be components that mix the two by only combining two separate components.

Sample apps should be built, generators for components and a website. (sry, no Yo, Slush?)

As I hope I'll have something done next year IE9 is for the moment the lowest target. (IE8 end of support lifecycle is 2016)

Don't know if ES6 or TS, yet. Edge versions to be used. As IE11 end of support lifecicle is 2023 it will be required to be compiled to ES5 until then. ES6 classes are broken (constructor, super, etc.) and will be, anyway, required to be compiled so, a better choice would be a compiled language that aims to closer future and is widely used.

Thinking like MeanJS, just a bit different. Something already done?

Dependency Injection, Swagger, REST, Sync, microdervices

Compatibility with desktop application build tools as Cordova, XDK, etc. Vagrant and Docker for development and deployment.
